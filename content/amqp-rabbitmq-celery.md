Summary: Some time ago I've mentioned that I've started figures painting as a hobby. My paints collection started to grow. Rapidly. And please don't blame me. Those colors are addictive.

Some time ago I've mentioned that I've started figures painting as a hobby. My paints collection started to grow. Rapidly. And please don't blame me. Those colors are addictive.

While feeding that addiction I've decided that it would be nice to build a custom shelf for those paints. And below is the final result.

Right now, I'm in the middle of transferring various paints from GW pots to 17ml bottles to make a better use of space on that shelf. To be honest, there are many other reasons as well.

Summary: Strongly inspired by other developer approach, personal need for
    reducing paid tools usage and having chances for 100% customization I've
    decided to search for WordPress.com alternative. Comparing a few of
    globally available solutions that met those criterias tend me to use
    Pelican.

Strongly inspired by other developer approach, personal need for reducing of paid tools usage and having opportunities for 100% customization I've decided to search for [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) alternative. Comparing a few of globally available solutions that met those criterias tend me to use [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).

The Pelican itself is just another Static Site Generator - where we create relatively dynamic content using known markup languages (like Markdown or reStructuredText) - and we generate static HTML output from those `sources`. Pelican supports many ways to publish our generated website to Amazon S3, GitHub pages, FTP to just a name a few.

Thanks to Jinja template language used in Pelican we're getting the possibility of fully customizing look and feel of our generated website.

Obviously I see Pelican as an experiment at this point and if there will be some problems in the future and Pelican won't be able to co-operate with me there will be an opportunity to try anything new - or alternatively write something by myself from ground up.

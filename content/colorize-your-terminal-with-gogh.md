Summary: I don't know how about you but I'm constantly looking for ideal color configuration for my terminal which will perfectly work with different message types. Because of such unique look of this terminal I'm just tickle my ego and feel extraordinary in some way. And procrastinate of course.

Not everyone can spend 32 hours a day in front of computer and just experiment with various setups, so some great developers got to a brilliant idea: create reusable color pallets.

Some time ago I've found a project [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/), and even if the idea itself is awesome, limit of colors used in those templates was insufficient for my needs. And that's I've started to dig deeper and found more colorful palettes - project called [Gogh](http://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh/).

More than 200 terminal themes ready to use at your fingertips are more than I need.

Summary: Today, on Monday, 21st of March I've hit 38. And it's terrifying. Mostly because I still don't know what makes me fully happy and perfectly balanced in my life.

Today, on Monday, 21st of March I've hit 38. And it's terrifying. Mostly because I still don't know what makes me fully happy and perfectly balanced in my life.

However, let's get a glance at the good part.

Last weekend I've spent about 8 hours playing Talisman as a personalised Character.

My wife ordered customized figurine and painted it by herself. One of the Character's special abilities is that I can kiss my wife whenever I win the skirmish with her. So I don't need to take her life or gold away :)

I would like to thank my wife by taking care of all the party stuff and to all guests for making that weekend great.

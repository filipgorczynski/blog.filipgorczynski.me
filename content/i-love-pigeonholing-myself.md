Summary: The way we behave in various life situations most often than not can be aligned with bunch of models that have been established last century. To understand myself better I've decided to take a couple of tests to clearly determine who I really am and why I behave that way? I hope it will also improve my career and makes me better at everything I do.

The way we behave in various life situations most often than not can be aligned with bunch of models that have been established last century. To understand myself better I've decided to take a couple of tests to clearly determine who I really am and why I behave that way? I hope it will also improve my career and makes me better at everything I do.

## CliftonStrengths/Gallup

CliftonStrengths test showed me that my top 5 strengths are:

1. Harmony (a relationship building theme)
2. Restorative (an executing theme)
3. Significance (an influencing theme)
4. Focus (an executing theme)
5. Competition (an influencing theme)

Awesome. But what does it actually mean?

-   Because of Harmony I look for consensus, don't enjoy conflict; rather, I seek areas of agreement.
-   Because of Restorative, I am adept at dealing with problems. I am good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it.
-   Because of Significance, I want to make a big impact. I am independent and prioritize projects based on how much influence they will have on organization or people around me.
-   Because of Focus, I can take a direction, follow through and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. I prioritize, then act.
-   Because of Competition, I measure my progress against the performance of others. I strive to win first place and revel in contests.

Few resources to get more into details with those strengths:

## 16 Personalities

Another test - Myers-Briggs Type Indicator - showed me, that I am: [INFJ-T (Advocate)](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality)

What does it mean?

By test page:

> An Advocate is someone with the **I**ntroverted, I**n**tuitive, **F**eeling, and **J**udging personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.

Additional T suffix stands from Turbulent which means I am likely to question myself more and are ordinarily more sensitive to stressors.

[specific strengths & weaknesses](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-strengths-and-weaknesses) according to this personality:

-   Strengths
    -   Creative
    -   Insightful
    -   Principled
    -   Passionate
    -   Altruistic
-   Weaknesses
    -   Sensitive to Criticism
    -   Reluctant to Open Up
    -   Perfectionistic
    -   Avoiding the Ordinary
    -   Prone to Burnout

> Advocates' gifts include idealism, determination, and the ability to envision a better future – but they don’t just want to hear what makes them great. Advocates are committed to actually using these gifts to become better people and serve a greater purpose in this world.

Also:

> Nothing lights up Advocates like changing someone else’s life for the better.

## DiSC

My personal DiSC style is: **C/S**

![DiSC dot](https://blog.filipgorczynski.me/images/post/2022/08/disc_dot.png)

What does it mean?

-   Compliant
    -   Cautious
    -   Careful
    -   Conscientious
    -   Calculating
    -   Condescending
-   Steady
    -   Stable

    -   Sincere
    -   Slow
    -   Sensitive
-   Conscientiousness
    -   Analytical
    -   Reserved
    -   Precise
    -   Private
    -   Systematic
-   Steadiness
    -   Even-tempered
    -   Accommodating
    -   Patient
    -   Humble
    -   Tactful

What motivates me? I will probably enjoy many of the following aspects of work:

-   Catching errors or flaws in design
-   Maintaining high standards
-   Bringing order to a project
-   Supporting people when they face a challenge
-   Solving problems through logic
-   Providing in-depth analysis
-   Ensuring accuracy and precision
-   Working steadily toward a goal
-   Being an expert

So what is stressing me out?

-   Working without clear guidelines
-   Making decisions without time for analysis

-   Dealing with a chaotic environment
-   Being wrong or unprepared
-   Dealing with emotional or erratic people
-   Operating in a political atmosphere
-   Being forceful or insistent
-   Initiating change and taking risks

Summaray of that DiSC

**My priorities:** ensuring accuracy, maintaining stability, challenging assumptions, giving support, enjoying collaboration
**I am motivated by:** opportunities to use expertise or gain knowledge, attention to quality, stable environments, sincere appreciation, cooperation, opportunities to help
**I am afraid of:** criticism, slipshod methods, being wrong, loss of stability, change, loss of harmony, offending others
**My limitations:** overly critical, tendency to overanalyze, isolates self, overly accommodating, tendency to avoid change, indecisiveness
**Other things that describes me:** precision, analysis, skepticism, reserve, quiet, patience, team player, calm approach, good listener, humility

## The Four Tendencies - Obliger

Yet another label I am sticking to is taken from the book ["The Four Tendencies" by Gretchen Rubin](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Tendencies-Indispensable-Personality-Profiles/dp/1473663709/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0).

Shortly, it means that I am described as: "Meets outer expectations, resists inner expectations" which is nothing more than making others happy before myself.

What does it mean?

-   Reliable
-   Responsible
-   Easy to get along with
-   Not following through with own goals
-   Overwork & Burnout
-   'Obliger Rebellion'

## The Predictive Index: Behavioral Assessment & Cognitive Assessment

Another tests I've took was [Predictive Index Behavioral Assessment](https://www.predictiveindex.com/assessments/behavioral-assessment/) and [Predictive Index Cognitive Assessment](https://www.predictiveindex.com/assessments/cognitive-assessment/).

According to the Behavioral report my primary behavioral drives are: Altruism.

And to summarize (from the report):

Filip is humble; he is not selfish and is genuinely interested in other people, understanding them well and intuitively. Open and friendly; he enjoys collaborating with others and is a lively, warm companion.

He is a pleasant and extroverted person who communicates effectively. Filip is capable of stimulating and motivating others while being aware of their needs and concerns and responding to them. His pleasant, friendly, and caring approach makes him very approachable. He collaborates easily with a wide range of people.

He strives to work with and for others. He derives particular satisfaction from doing things for others: for the company, management, team, and clients. He is eager to collaborate; he can teach and communicate company policies, programs, and systems particularly effectively.

He works at an above-average pace; he pays attention to detail and works on them quickly and thoroughly. Despite this, he is too impatient to enjoy working on details, whether within repetitive routines or his core responsibilities.

He zealously ensures that tasks are carried out exactly as they should be; if his work requires delegating individual tasks to others, Filip will conduct careful and thorough monitoring. If he must be critical, he will do so in a constructive and supportive manner. His sense of urgency and sense of duty make him actively concerned with deadlines and the accuracy of every job for which he is responsible.

Fundamentally, Filip is a cautious and attentive person, respecting superiors and tradition; he is a specialist who ensures that tasks are completed correctly and in accordance with the company's formal organizational structure, avoiding risk and uncertainty.

## Summary

According to the results it's clearly seen that I'm not a hustle culture member, even if I would like to be like that.

The biggest challenge will be following what I learned about myself to improve my work(flow) to become better software developer, to use my strenghts to the fullest and understand weaknesses to make the world a better place, not just for myself.

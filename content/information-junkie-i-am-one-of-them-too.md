Summary: Recommended YouTube video about newest and fanciest JavaScript library. Another Django or Vue.js course. New book about the framework or architecture pattern used at FAANG. Yet another time management approach, ultra-productivity and procrastination-preventing trick. Between courses endless stream from HackerNews and blog feeds. And of course don't forget to check newsletters you are subscribed to.

Being information junkie is highly connected with Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), with low self-esteem, with impostor syndrome to just name a few. The final list could be endless.

FOMO, which is the case where we feel that we get out of the information stream when we skip some of them


How often do you ask yourself: Do I really need it right now? How does it improve my life?

I solely do, however

I'm aware there is "Consumer" and "Producer" mindset. I also know that Producer mindset is far way better.

By focusing on information and not action, you're actually limiting your education and self-growth by ignoring the importance of getting hands-on experience and real world knowledge.

One important question to ask yourself is:

> "What am I creating on a daily basis? How am I adding value to the world and not just subtracting from it?"

Summary: Recommended YouTube video about newest and fanciest JavaScript library, another Machine Learning course, new book about the framework or architecture pattern used by FAANG, yet another time management approach, and meanwhile of course endless stream from HackerNews and blog feeds.

Being information junkie is strongly connected with FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out, the case where we feel that we get out of the information stream when we skip some information.

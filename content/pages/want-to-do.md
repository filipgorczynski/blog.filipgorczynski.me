Slug: want-to-do
Status: draft

A curated (or let's call it comprehensive) list of my want to do's & projects that I want to build but probably never will:

-   setup dockerized MERN stack skeleton as project template & describe whole process
-   setup dockerized Django+Django REST Framework + React/Vue + PostgreSQL skeleton as project template & describe whole process
-   build a project with custom battle-ready components with Storybook for building other projects faster
-   build a project that allows me to represent all friends from Twitter/Facebook and categorize them in a graph way

## Blog Roadmap

-   Add a search form & results
-   Add a subscription form
-   Add a cookie notice & compliance
-   Improve "donate" button
-   "Share via Mastodon, Twitter, Facebook..." buttons

Summary: Too many tabs opened within a browser are a quite common problem amongst IT people. Google something and a few seconds ago you are overwhelmed by 20 newly opened tabs. Yes, your RAM usage bar blinks in red as well.

Thanks to my friend from work I've learned a new feature built into Chrome browser that helps me organize related tabs into groups. Funny thing is, that this feature is available in a browser a few releases back now.

One caveat I have is that it does not allow pinning grouped tabs but still, it's better than a neverending list - sometimes duplicated - tabs.

In the case of this post, I recalled one productivity idea that pushes you to open a new browser window every time you want to search for something, so you can close it after found.

Summary: Too many tabs opened in browser is quite common problem amongs IT people. Google something and few seconds ago you are overwhelmed by 20 newly oRpened tabs. Yes, your computer RAM usage bar blinks in red as well.

Thanks to my friend from work I've learned a new feature built into Chrome browser that helps me organize related tabs into one group. Funny thing is, that this feature is available in browser few releases back now.

Of course it's not the only one solution I'm using with tabs in Chrome. I've also installed: TooManyTabs, TabSnooze i The Great Suspender.

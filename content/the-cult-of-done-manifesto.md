Summary: Do you feel overwhelmed by constant hustling, moving your boundaries much too far which drives you crazy due to all the goals you planned to accomplish to make your inner perfectionist happy?

So do I. While searching an easy solution to beat this procrastinator feeling I've found "The Cult of Done manifesto" document.

One (from the many) of my problems is that I have a feeling, that I need to postpone action until I'll be completely ready.This way I'm not as good as I could be with software development, being entrepreneur or many other things - because I'm still not perfectly ready. Even if I know I'll never be fully prepared I'm still not satisfied and procrastinate.

So what exactly "The Cult of Done" manifesto really is?



I think the best way to summarize this attitude is a quote by Theodore Roosevelt.

> "The only person who never makes a mistake is the person who never does anything."

Just to note, there were a few more people that explains this idea with just different words.

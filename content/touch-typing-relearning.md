Summary: I decided to check how "good" is my keyboard writing. It could definitely gone better. But right now the problem is muscle memory and habit of writing improperly.

I decided to check how "good" is my keyboard writing. It could definitely gone better. But right now the problem is muscle memory and habit of writing improperly.

Through all those years as a software developer I've seen others who were able to touch type faster with less mistakes. For me it's still one of the obstacle to become a better developer. Why? Because typos distracts me. Also, writing faster will help me to become better communicator.

Without further waiting for New Year's resolutions, I'll do my best to make a habit of everyday touch typing practice. The goal will be to relearn muscle memory and improve my typing speed and decrease number of typos.

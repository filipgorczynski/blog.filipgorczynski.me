Warhammer 40000 10th edition showed up this year and new rules come into play. And not everything is that clear, especially for newcomers. I belongs to them too.

For Necrons, Army Rule is the Reanimation Protocol.

To clear this rule up, I've tried to summarize it (with great help of Discord Community):

- Despite a unit has one or more models and has no wounds nor models lost - just do nothing and be happy.
- Otherwise, on each end of my Command Phase I roll D3 for each unit, that has models or wounds lost, and:
  - If this unit is just one model with lost wounds add D3 result to "heal" that model; everything over the reanimation roll is lost.
  - If that unit has many models, 1W each, and has some models lost: recover D3 results models.
  - If that unit has many models, but 2+W each:
    - ~~If there are only models lost, we reanimate D3 results models in that unit; with each model Wounds set to 1 (so they're one-shots now)~~
    - You return a model with an amount of wounds amounting to the D3, up to its maximum wounds. If there are still wounds leftover on the D3 you repeat the process, returning another model. Basically it goes return -> heal to full -> return -> heal to full.
    - (most complicated scenario for me so please correct me if I'm wrong) If there are models lost and some are wounded we firstly reanimate D3 results models as above (just to revive them to 1W), BUT when there are still points on the roll results we can "heal" wounded models too?
- If other models in a unit are still wounded, they're considered as "dead" and can wait for another Command Phase to another D3 roll.
- How to approach to those "Reanimation Protocol", if one model is Leading (and is Wounded) a Bodyguard unit; does this Leader should be treated separately, or I just can revive Leader to 1W and other Bodyguard models?


Most of your mistakes can be fixed with this statement: You cannot return a model as long as there is a damaged model in the unit; you must heal up damaged models first


For leaders it's the same. They're a part of the unit and, if damaged, must be healed first. But note that when a leader dies, then he no longer counts as part of the unit and therefore cannot be brought back using Reanimation Protocols. If you don't use Eternal Guardian when a leader dies then they're gone for good

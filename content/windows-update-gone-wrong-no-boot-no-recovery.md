After installing a recent Windows 10 update, my system refuses to boot. Even worse, there's no way to uninstall the updates - at least not successfully.
While the recovery interface does offer options to remove specific updates, none of them seem to work. I'm not sure whether these are just broken features or placeholders, but the end result is the same: no recovery through standard means.

As a legitimate Windows 10 license holder, I expected at least to be able to create a recovery USB. Unfortunately, that's not possible either - not from my current situation. I'm now locked out of Windows and left using Linux. Microsoft's official website refuses to let me download a Windows 10 ISO directly from a non-Windows system. The only thing it offers is a `.exe` file designed to create a bootable device - but, of course, that tool requires a working Windows machine.

It's a frustrating loop: I need Windows to recover Windows, but Windows won't boot.

What is wrong with you, Microsoft?

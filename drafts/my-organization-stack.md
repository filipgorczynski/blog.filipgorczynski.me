Summary: List of tools intended for improving our productivity is almost endless. One better from the other. Free and paid. From minimalistic to-do list to fully-fledged ultimate-life-management. From simple markup format to fanciest and animated interfaces. From mobile version to standalone applications.

Do you see yourself in the group of people who still jumps between tools and search the perfect one?

According to the sentence "new year, new me" I find it to be a good time to reflect on the systems and tools I use to stay organized, and make changes as necessary. Below I describe my current "organization stack" with their pros and cons - of course from my perspective. In my oponion those tools are great, but finally we should have system that work for us and we should not adjust our work to the tools we have.

## Todoist

This is my primary To-Do list tool and day organizing.

I'm trying to push myself into 1-3-5 rule: 1 task with highest priority, 3 tasks with medium priority and 5 tasks with lowest priority. Todoist allows to set 4 different priorities.

## VSCode

Second one is VS Code editor. Lot of extensions allows me to integrate it with Clockify

## Google Calendar

Third one is the old good Google Calendar. I'm using many calendars for grouping.

## Clockify

Fourth one is for time tracking.

## Physical Notes

Last but not least, even if I'm a big fan of having everything online, I'm still using pen & paper for daily notes. The biggest problem with this form is that I don't digitalize them so finally they're just a piles of paper.

## But I'm not fully satisfied
